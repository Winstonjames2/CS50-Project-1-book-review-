- This is CS50 project 1-book review project. 
- You need to install virtual environment by writing **'python -m venv venv'** in cmd in windows.
- You need to activate virtual environment by writing **'venv\Scripts\activate'**.
- Then install flask **'pip install flask'**, **'pip install requests'**, **'pip install flask_sessions'**,**'pip install flask_sqlalchemy'**.
- Then in cmd write **'set FLASK_APP=application.py'** to let know the flask the app. 
- To debug on write **'set FLASK_ENV=development'**.
- To run the application in flask server, **'flask run'**.
- I used review api from goodreads. 
- This is not flawless.
